        While the term "Public Food Shelter" isn't commonly used in Chennai,
        the city has initiatives like Amma Canteens offering subsidized meals
        to the needy at various locations. Additionally, numerous NGOs and food
        banks work to distribute food to vulnerable populations across Chennai,
        ensuring access to nourishment for those who need it most.
